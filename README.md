A repository to track the development of the semester project assigned in CEN 3031 - Software Engineering 1.

The following is subject to change based on the way Professor Pinto wants us to do things, but in my experience this seems to be standard practice in the real world.
Clone the development branch on your machine. 

All work should be done on a development branch which is based on the main branch.

If a feature branch is being utilized, it should be based on the development branch so the feature can be tested prior to mergin into the main (production) branch.
